# JavaScript-Notes

## History of JavaScript

*JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java.
*JavaScript has become the de-facto standard programming language of the Web, not only because of its first-mover advantage, but because it is open, standardized, and, most importantly a very good language; well-suited to the Web with its dynamic nature and tight integration with the DOM.

—>The unique circumstances of the birth of the language, including:
* the aforementioned marketing ploy,
* time-compressed initial development,
* a prejudice that development for the Web was not “serious”,
* the ubiquitous and “unbreakable” deployment environment (the Web), and
* the inclusion of language design elements unfamiliar to most developers
